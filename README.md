# THE KICKOFF

## Description:
Football is the most popular sport globally, uniting fans across cultures and continents. The Kickoff aims to be for exploring the vibrant world of professional football leagues. This project presents a user-friendly interface to explore competitions retrieved from a football API. It displays cards for each competition, allowing you to view basic information initially and delve into detailed specifics upon clicking the card.
